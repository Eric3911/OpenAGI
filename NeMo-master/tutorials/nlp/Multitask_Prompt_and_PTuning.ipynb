     "# Introduction\n",
     "\n",
     "In this notebook we demonstrate how to use p-tuning and prompt tuning within NeMo-Megatron. Both methods are parameter efficient alternatives to fine-tuning pretrained language models. Our NeMo implementation makes it possible to use one pretrained GPT model on many downstream tasks without needing to tune the model’s full set of parameters. It also allows for adding new tasks to your model without overwriting or disrupting previous tasks for which the model has already been p-tuned/prompt-tuned. Because the original model parameters are frozen and never altered by either method, p-tuning/prompt-tuning also avoid catastrophic forgetting issues often encountered when fine-tuning models.\n",
     "\n",
     "- Our prompt tuning implementation is based off Lester et. al’s EMNLP 2021 paper [The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691)\n",
     "\n",
     "- Our p-tuning implementation is based off Liu et al's paper [GPT Understands, Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10385).\n",
     "\n",
     "- Command line usage examples and API documentation can be found in [our user docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/main/nlp/nemo_megatron/prompt_learning.html). \n",

     "\n",
     "Our continuous learning capability for combined p-tuning and prompt tuning with GPT style models is a NeMo specific extension of the author’s original work.\n",
     "\n",
     "# The Plan\n",
     "\n",
     "We are going to show you how to:\n",
     "    \n",
     "    1. P-Tune/Prompt Tune a model on multiple tasks at the same time\n",
     "    2. Add a new task to a model that has already been P-Tuned/Prompt Tuned previously\n",
     "    \n",
     "We will first p-tune a GPT model on sentiment analysis, and intent and slot classification tasks. Then we will show how to add the squad question answering task to the same model we already p-tuned once.\n",
     "\n",
     "\n",
     "# Technical Overview\n",
     "Instead of selecting discrete text prompts in a manual or automated fashion, prompt tuning and p-tuning utilize virtual prompt embeddings that can be optimized via gradient decent. The only difference between prompt tuning and p-tuning within NeMo-Megatron is the architecture used to tune the soft prompt tokens during training.\n",
     "\n",
     "### Terminology\n",
     "We will be using the terms `continuous`, `soft`, and `virtual` token interchangeably to refer to embeddings inserted into the model prompt that have no concrete mapping to strings or characters within the model’s vocabulary. These virtual token embeddings exist in contrast to the `discrete`, `hard`, or `real` tokens that do make up the model’s vocabulary. Virtual tokens are purely 1D vectors with dimensionality equal to that of each real token embedding, matching the `hidden_size` hyperparameter. In training and inference, continuous token embeddings are inserted among discrete token embeddings according to a template you provide in the model’s config. We will demonstrate how to do this below.\n",
     "\n",
     "When referring to p-tuning and prompt tuning together, we will be using the phrase prompt learning for simplicity.\n",
     "\n",
     "### Prompt-Tuning\n",
     "In prompt-tuning a pretrained GPT model, soft prompt embeddings are initialized as a 2D matrix of size `total_virtual_tokens X hidden_size`. Each task the model is prompt-tuned to perform has its own 2D embedding matrix associated with it. Tasks do not share any parameters during training or inference. All GPT model parameters are frozen and only the embedding parameters for each task are updated during training.\n",
     "\n",
     "In prompt tuning you can specify how the embeddings are initialized for each task. You can either\n",
     "\n",
     "1. Initialize embedding parameters according to some random distribution\n",
     "2. Initialize embedding parameters from existing vocabulary embeddings (recommended)\n",
     "\n",
     "If you choose to initialize virtual token embeddings from existing embedding weights, you can provide the string of words you want to use for initialization in the model’s config. This string will be tokenized and tiled or truncated to match the specified number of virtual tokens you would like to use (`total_virtual_tokens`). Vocab embeddings are copied and used to initialize the soft prompt embedding matrix for each task. The vocab embeddings themselves are not updated or changed during prompt tuning.\n",
     "\n",
     "\n",
     "### P-Tuning\n",
     "In p-tuning, an LSTM model is used to predict virtual token embeddings. We refer to this LSTM model as our `prompt_encoder`. LSTM parameters are randomly initialized at the start of p-tuning. All GPT model parameters are frozen, and only the LSTM weights are updated at each training step. LSTM parameters are shared between all tasks that are p-tuned at the same time, but the LSTM model outputs unique virtual token embeddings for each task. The virtual tokens predicted by the LSTM are inserted among the discrete token input in the exact same manner as with prompt-tuning. You still specify the number of virtual tokens you want to use by setting `total_virtual_tokens` and each virtual token embedding is still a 1D vector of size `hidden_size`.\n",
     "\n",
     "\n",
     "\n",
     "# The Best of Both\n",
     "A single pretrained GPT model can use both p-tuning and prompt-tuning. While you must decide to use either p-tuning or prompt-tuning for each task you want your model to perform, you can p-tune your model on a set of tasks A, then prompt tune your same model on a different set of tasks B, then finally run inference on tasks from both A and B at the same time. During prompt-tuning or p-tuning, tasks tuned at the same time must use the same number of virtual tokens. During inference, tasks using differing amounts of virtual tokens can be run at the same time.\n",
     "\n",
     "Please see our [docs for more comparisons between prompt and p-tuning](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/main/nlp/nemo_megatron/prompt_learning.html). \n",
     "\n",
