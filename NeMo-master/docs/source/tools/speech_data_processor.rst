Speech Data Processor
========================

Speech Data Processor (SDP) is a toolkit to make it easy to:
  1. write code to process a new dataset, minimizing the amount of boilerplate code required.
  2. share the steps for processing a speech dataset. Sharing processing steps can be as easy as sharing a YAML file.
